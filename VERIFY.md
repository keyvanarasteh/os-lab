# OS-30 verification

## Current local submission checks (2026-11-14)

Starting HEAD: `d5ba261d27a8e50f862a22a3b8602c3fbef18354` on
`feat/os-30-delivery`. Working tree was clean before preparation. The removed
`23207910` commit is not an ancestor of HEAD and was not restored.
Environment: macOS / Darwin arm64, Python 3.14.3.

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v`: **114 tests passed in
  44.626s**, exit 0. Fake commands, temporary files and fake PTY operations only.
- `.venv-test/bin/shellcheck linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`:
  passed, exit 0, using the existing local executable.
- `bash -n linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`: passed, exit 0.
- `git diff --check`: passed before documentation preparation.

The new quoted-Ubuntu regression was first run against the original collector:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -p test_hardening.py -k quoted`
failed as expected (exit 1): `ID="ubuntu"` was incorrectly rejected with exit 2.
The collector now accepts that form consistently with Python. The test uses
synthetic release data and checks that the audit performs no mutations.

Final focused suite: `python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v`:
**115 tests passed in 54.810s**, exit 0, after the quoted-ID change.

Post-change Python AST parsing passed for the entry point and three test files;
Bash syntax, ShellCheck and `git diff --check` passed again.

Repository runner command (existing virtualenv; dependency downloads disabled):

```bash
PATH="$PWD/.venv-test/bin:$PATH" CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true PIP_NO_INDEX=1 \
  PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 ./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

The first sandboxed attempt failed in Android localhost tests and Cleanup Lab.
It was rerun with local socket access. During that attempt the collector was
edited while Bash was reading it, causing a transient `T: command not found`
failure in one OS-30 test (115 run, one failure). This attempt is not final
verification; the complete runner was restarted after all executable/test files
were stable. The independent final focused run above passed all 115 tests.
The final stable-source runner reports:

- Android/console: 170 passed, 5 failed, 2 skipped. Failures cover ARM64 asset
  selection versus amd64 fixtures, source-console guards/download, and lab-plan
  HTTP status expectations. The earlier attempt also hit a connection reset.
- OS-30: 115 tests passed in the final full runner as well.
- Source Lab engine: 176 passed.
- Cleanup reference: 35 passed.
- Cleanup engine: 228 run; 4 failures and 5 errors, involving relocation paths
  and safety expectations on this host.
- Cargo absent; Rust suite skipped. Dashboard dependencies absent; dashboard
  checks skipped (dashboard unchanged).

Final runner result: exit 1; **5 stages passed, 2 failed, 3 skipped**.
Sample analysis/report smoke and syntax parsing of all 71 shell scripts passed.
Reservation required fields, allowed fields and status/course enum checks passed.

The failing Android/console/Cleanup sources and `lat.md/cleanup-lab.md` have no
changes against target `5924675c`. They were not edited as part of OS-30.

`npx --offline --yes --cache /tmp/os30-delivery-npm-cache --package lat.md lat check`
ran after graph edits and exited 1: the existing leading paragraph under
`lat.md/cleanup-lab.md:237` is 339 characters (limit 250). No OS-30 graph error
was reported. The tool was fetched into a temporary cache; no `lat init`,
global installation or agent hooks were added.

No live Ubuntu audit, repair, rollback, demo or new video was performed. Earlier WSL2
and UTM records below describe their original revisions, not this new run.

## Historical WSL2 regression: OS-30 fixes on `bdcc521` (2026-11-13)

Tested tree: base commit `bdcc521981f0825310aee6f712c6d64b1ab12b70`
(`feat/os-30-hardening-checker`) plus the **uncommitted** OS-30 fixes in
`linux-lab/scripts/` and `linux-lab/tests/` (5 files, 730 insertions, 85
deletions). Nothing was committed or pushed, so there is no commit hash for the
fixes themselves. The applied patch is `git diff -- linux-lab/scripts
linux-lab/tests` with SHA-256
`19e8e4a2b2cd7ff3e456196d23bebe4d43c24003495a2c22472ab5efcd3fe0c4`.
Documentation changes are not part of that hash.

Environment: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS on WSL2, kernel
`6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2`, x86_64; Python 3.12.3; GNU bash
5.2.21(1)-release. Tests ran as an unprivileged user in a fresh LF clone
outside the Windows checkout (`git clone --depth 1` of the branch, then
`git apply` of the patch).

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline, unpatched `bdcc521` | `python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests` | 97 tests, OK, exit 0 |
| Fixed tree | `python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v` | **114 tests, OK, exit 0** (34.5 s) |
| Reverse check: new tests only, on unpatched `bdcc521` | same | FAILED (26 failures, 13 errors), exit 1, as intended |
| Syntax | `bash -n linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh`; `bash -n scripts/run-tests.sh` | passed |
| Whitespace | `git diff --check` | passed |

The 114 tests are 27 Bash collector tests, 47 Python repair/CLI/guard/PTY/audit
tests and 40 rollback/terminal tests. The 17 new regression tests cover:

- UFW: same-connection deny/reject/limit (with or without log/comment) refused
  in plan and apply with no `ufw` mutation; an equivalent allow shown as SKIP and
  never retagged; rules differing in direction, interface, source port,
  protocol, source address or route kept unchanged while one new rule is
  appended; an unparseable rule naming the source refused; a conflicting rule
  appearing after the permission change detected by the recheck immediately
  before `ufw allow`, with the permission change reversed.
- Interruption: real SIGTERM and SIGHUP delivered to a forked test process
  during apply reverse the mode and timer changes and record status
  `interrupted` with reverted/unreverted items. A verified run-tagged UFW rule is
  removed by its exact specification; an unverified addition is left and
  reported. CLI exit codes are 130/129/143. `interrupted`, `failed` and `applying`
  manifests are refused by rollback with a pointer to manual recovery.
- Audit: truncated output, a summary count mismatch, a summary that is not
  last or is duplicated, an exit-code mismatch, unexpected exit codes and a
  killed collector all exit 2 in text and JSON. Platform and collector errors
  produce valid JSON. A real collector stopping inside a check exits 2 instead
  of 1. Text and JSON agree on real collector output for four mock scenarios.
- Socket attribution: Bash attributes every `ssh.socket` `Listen` entry, both
  one per line and on a single line, and yields the same ports as
  `listening_ports()` in Python.

Not run: ShellCheck (no executable in this environment; nothing was installed),
the full repository runner (its preparation can install dependencies) and
`lat check`. Evidence boundary: everything above uses fake commands, temporary
files and an x86_64 WSL2 kernel. It is not a live Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 UTM run.
Live apply and rollback remain unverified, and real UFW rule rendering and
replacement behaviour are verified only against the upstream ufw source and the
test fake.

## Historical local regression

Environment: macOS, branch `feat/os-30-hardening-checker`.
Recorded rollback regression command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v
```

Result: **94 tests passed in 19.494s**, exit 0:

- 24 Bash audit tests with PATH command mocks.
- 31 Python repair/CLI/guard tests, including real PTY confirmation tests.
- 39 rollback tests covering snapshots, allowed targets, invalid IDs, traversal,
  symlinks/hardlinks, ownership/modes, corrupt manifests, post-state drift,
  timer recovery, exact UFW rule identity, partial failure and safe repetition.

System commands are fake and file mutations are limited to temporary fixtures.
PTY tests invoke fake repair/rollback operations. No actual SSH, UFW, accounts,
packages or services are modified. Schema-2 rollback is not live-verified in UTM.

Additional recorded checks passed:

- Python AST parsing of `harden_check.py`, `test_harden_check.py` and `test_rollback.py`.
- `bash -n linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`.
- `.venv-test/bin/shellcheck linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`.
- `git diff --check`, plus whitespace/final-newline checks on untracked files.
- `npx --offline --yes --cache /tmp/os30-npm-cache --package lat.md lat check`.
  The existing no-init-version warning did not prevent success; no initialization
  or hooks were installed.

## Full repository runner: pre-rollback revision

```bash
PATH="$PWD/.venv-test/bin:$PATH" PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 \
  npx --offline --yes --cache /tmp/os30-npm-cache --package lat.md \
  --call './scripts/run-tests.sh'
```

Recorded result: **exit 0; 5 stages passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped**.

- OS-30: 55 tests passed in 45.583s, before explicit rollback tests were added.
- Android: 51 passed, 1 skipped in 36.51s.
- Sample analysis/report smoke passed.
- All 54 Bash scripts parsed.
- `lat check` passed.
- Dashboard verification skipped: dependencies absent; dashboard unchanged.

Earlier attempts failed because test dependencies were unavailable and sandbox
permissions blocked localhost test sockets. These were resolved by provisioning
pytest/requests/cryptography in the ignored `.venv-test` and permitting local test
sockets. Dependency provisioning was separate from offline test execution.
ShellCheck was installed only in `.venv-test`; lat used a temporary npm cache.
No system or VM package installation was performed. The runner generates ignored
sample APK/report artifacts; those are not OS-30 live-audit evidence.

## Operator-reported UTM checks

Text audit and read-only permission planning were reported as completed on an
Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 lab without applying changes. These checks belong to an earlier
revision and were not re-executed during integration. Raw audit findings, measured
server configuration, real account names, addresses/hostnames and local paths are
not retained in the shared verification record.

Live JSON audit, apply and rollback are unverified. Local fake-command and PTY
tests must not be presented as live Ubuntu verification.

## Rollback usage and evidence boundary

```text
sudo python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py rollback <run-id>
```

The command requires a valid private schema-2 backup, root, input/output TTYs and
exact `ROLLBACK OS-30 <run-id>` confirmation. Legacy or incomplete evidence and
file/timer drift refuse restoration. Unproven UFW state results in partial
rollback without deleting rules. See
[the recovery guide](linux-lab/knowledge/hardening.md#explicit-rollback-of-a-completed-run).

The command above is usage documentation, not a live execution result.
Live apply/rollback require separately reviewed changes and a recoverable lab.
Do not install pending upgrades or refresh APT metadata as part of audit.
Video evidence has not been supplied. Any recorded demonstration should clearly
use synthetic fixtures or sanitized summaries and distinguish reported lab
checks from mocked apply/rollback evidence. Do not copy raw server audit output
or identifying account, address, hostname, local-path or key material.

## Pre-commit integration checks (historical, before `bdcc521`)

Scope: the canonical Python entry point, companion audit-only Bash collector,
selected repair/rollback operations and focused tests. The Python entry point
refuses missing/empty collectors and successful collector executions returning
no findings. Raw server audit output is excluded from this record.

The focused suite needs only Python's standard library; no package installation,
network access or live security operation is required. Results recorded below
are new executions and are separate from the historical runs above.

Latest pre-delivery checks (after the test-runner cd guard was restored):

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v`: **97 tests passed in
  52.513s**, exit 0 (24 Bash collector, 34 Python repair/CLI/guard/PTY,
  39 rollback/terminal). Three added regressions cover missing/empty collectors
  and a collector that returns no findings.
- Python AST parsing: passed for the entry point and all three OS-30 test files.
- `bash -n linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`: passed, exit 0.
- `.venv-test/bin/shellcheck linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh scripts/run-tests.sh`:
  passed, exit 0; the existing installed executable was used.
- `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`: passed, exit 0.
- After all 97 tests and static checks passed, the reviewed OS-30 files and
  README image were staged. The staged documents were verified against the
  working files; no commit or push was made. Subsequent documentation corrections
  require their own staging review.
- `lat check`: could not run because no executable was installed. Attempted
  `npx --yes --cache /tmp/os30-lat-cache --package lat.md lat check` with bounded
  fetch time and no retries. Package retrieval failed with `ENOTFOUND` for
  `registry.npmjs.org`; the checker never started. Git status was unchanged
  before/after the attempt. No global installation or `lat init` was performed.
- The full repository runner was not rerun because its existing preparation can
  install dependencies. Historical results above are not new integration results.

No live audit was run during this integration or the local pre-delivery checks.
An operator reported UTM text audit and read-only plan execution on an earlier
revision, as described above; those are separate from local mock tests.
Live JSON audit, apply and rollback remain unverified. No package installation,
commit or push was performed. The npx package-access attempt above failed before
the graph checker could run; it is not a passing graph validation.
