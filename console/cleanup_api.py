"""Cleanup Lab HTTP contracts (``/api/cleanup/...``).

The console accepts typed, validated calls only: never a command string and never
a free-form path list from the page (``cleanup-lab/README.md``). Ready:
readiness (CLN-01), the detector catalog (CLN-02), the scan job (CLN-03) and the
plan → clean flow (CLN-13) and audit history (CLN-15); the remaining endpoints add
their own actions here, each validated again by the engine's safety guard.

The engine is imported from ``cleanup-lab/engine`` (``cleanup_lab``), which is a
plain standard-library package: the console does not install it.

Long work runs as an in-process console job: ``POST /api/cleanup/scan`` starts a
scan, ``POST /api/cleanup/plan`` builds a plan (guard, measure, fingerprint),
``POST /api/cleanup/clean {planId}`` runs a confirmed plan — each on a worker
thread polled through ``GET /api/cleanup/jobs/<id>`` and cancelled through
``POST /api/cleanup/jobs/<id>/cancel``. The job store keeps the most recent
:data:`MAX_JOBS` jobs; the plan store keeps the most recent :data:`MAX_PLANS`
plans with the fingerprints that expire them. Both live only in this console
process, like the lab jobs: a restart loses them, and nothing is persisted.
