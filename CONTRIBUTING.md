# Contributing to os-lab

Thanks for your interest in contributing! os-lab builds isolated security labs
(Android, Windows, Linux and macOS/iOS) and a web console that drives them.
Contributions of all kinds are welcome: code, documentation, Frida hooks,
workflow recipes, translations and bug reports.

## Ground rules

- **Authorization only.** Everything here is for testing systems and apps you
  own or are authorized in writing to assess, inside isolated labs. Do not
  contribute content, artifacts or examples taken from systems you were not
  authorized to test. See the [Acceptable Use Policy](docs/legal/ACCEPTABLE_USE.md).
- **No third-party binaries or proprietary media.** Do not commit APKs you do
  not own, Windows or macOS images, Google's platform-tools or other vendor
  binaries. Download them at setup time from the vendor instead (see
  `android-lab/lab/scripts/get_platform_tools.py`).
- **Compatible licences only.** New dependencies must have a licence compatible
  with Apache-2.0 and must be added to the
  [Third-Party Notices](docs/legal/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
- **No secrets or personal data** in code, tests, fixtures or screenshots.
- Changing Firewall Lab companies, guides or hooks? They ship to users as a signed content pack; see
  [Content updates](docs/CONTENT.md) for how, and for the optional proof (verification report, video) that speeds review.
- Be respectful: see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Found a vulnerability in os-lab itself? Follow the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md);
  do **not** open a public issue.

## Step 1: Set up

You need git, Python 3.11 or newer and bash (Linux, macOS or WSL2). Node.js 22+
is only needed to work on the dashboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/os-lab   # your fork
cd os-lab
git remote add upstream https://github.com/keyvanarasteh/os-lab
./labctl ui                                  # the web console at http://127.0.0.1:5050
```

The one-command installers in [`scripts/setup/`](scripts/setup/README.md) also
set up a virtualenv and the dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a branch

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b feat/short-description upstream/master   # or fix/…, docs/…, chore/…
```

Keep each pull request to one logical change.

## Step 3: Make the change

| Area | Where | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Android lab scripts | `android-lab/lab/scripts/` | Prefer the Python standard library; expose a `main()` and importable helpers |
| Frida hooks | `android-lab/lab/hooks/` | One concern per file, with a header comment saying what it bypasses or traces and how to load it |
| Web console API and lab engine | `android-lab/lab/web_ui.py`, `console/oslab.py` | Lab actions must stay typed and validated; never accept command strings from the page |
| Dashboard | `dashboard/src/` | Astro + React + Tailwind; run `npm run dev` with the console on port 5050 |
| VM labs | `win-lab/`, `linux-lab/`, `ios-lab/`, `labctl` | `bash` with `set -euo pipefail` |
| Windows lab script | `android-lab/lab/lab.ps1`, `scripts/setup/install.ps1` | Must parse in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7; keep **UTF-8 with BOM** |
| Legal documents | `docs/legal/` | Shown in the dashboard at `/legal/`; every statement must match what the code does |

For the Android lab runbook see [`android-lab/lab/README.md`](android-lab/lab/README.md),
for Windows non-admin use [`android-lab/lab/README-WINDOWS.md`](android-lab/lab/README-WINDOWS.md),
and for iOS [`ios-lab/README.md`](ios-lab/README.md).

## Curated Contribution Roadmap & Priority TODOs

Looking for high-impact areas to contribute? The following curated tasks are classified across our three core domains: **Penetration Testing**, **Open Source Operating Systems**, and **Firewall Solutions**. They incorporate architectural patterns from our desktop runtime (local MCP hosting, capability discovery, single-instance execution, release profile tuning) and real-world security engineering instrumentation.

These tasks are also interactively browsable and filterable inside the dashboard under the **Contribute → Roadmap & TODOs** tab.

### Reserving a task

So two people don't build the same thing, **reserve a task before you start**. A reservation is just a
PR that adds one file, `reservations/<TASK-ID>.json` (one file per task, so reservations never conflict).
The easiest way is the **Reserve via PR** button on each task card, which opens a pre-filled PR for you;
by hand, copy the template in [`reservations/README.md`](reservations/README.md). The dashboard shows each
task as Available, Reserved, PR open or Done, and you keep your file's `status`/`pr` current as you go.
Course midterm reservations add a `course` (and an option number in `note`) — see the course's
`vize/vize-projesi.md`.

#### Bonus — shipped reference tools (not reservable)

These are already implemented and merged under
[`linux-lab/scripts/bonus/`](linux-lab/scripts/bonus/). They close recurring
gaps that are not covered by OS-01…OS-40 and are **not** vize tasks — reserve an
`OS-…` row above instead. Read them as worked examples of the lab's script style:
read-only, `set -euo pipefail`, clear exit codes (`0` clean / `1` problem /
`2` usage), portable between macOS and Linux, no external tools required.

| ID | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **OS-B1** | `env-doctor.sh` | Validates a lab `.env` against its `.env.example` — missing keys, empty values, unknown/extra keys, duplicates (`--json` for CI). Nothing today checks a copied `.env` for drift. |
| **OS-B2** | `port-check.sh` | Reports whether the lab's `WEB_PORT`/`SSH_PORT` (or ports you pass) are free on `127.0.0.1` via bash `/dev/tcp`, catching the "port already allocated" start failure before `make up`. |
| **OS-B3** | `ssh-config-doctor.sh` | Summarises each `~/.ssh/config` Host block and flags a missing `HostName`, an absent `IdentityFile`, or a key with group/other-readable permissions that `ssh` silently ignores. |
| **OS-B4** | `shell-lint.sh` | `bash -n` (the repo's required gate) over the `*.sh` you touched, plus `shellcheck` advisories when installed — a scoped pre-PR check instead of the whole-repo `run-tests.sh`. |
| **OS-B5** | `md-linkcheck.sh` | Verifies local (non-http) Markdown links resolve on disk, so a typo'd path in `VERIFY.md`/`REPORT.md`/docs is caught before it becomes a dead link. |
| **OS-B6** | `secret-scan.sh` | Scans for known credential signatures (PEM/OpenSSH keys, AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google tokens) and reports `file:line` + rule with the value **redacted**; `--staged` for a pre-commit check. Complements the release scripts' tracked-key guard. |

### 2b. Cleanup Lab (CLN)

A disk-cleanup lab that ports [Qleaner](https://github.com/keyvanarasteh/Qleaner)'s scan detections,
detection signatures and clean techniques into os-lab. Only the behaviour is ported: pages follow the
os-lab dashboard and [`docs/UX_READINESS.md`](docs/UX_READINESS.md), and Qleaner's known bugs must not be
copied. Contract, safety rules, the port map and the bug list: [`cleanup-lab/README.md`](cleanup-lab/README.md).
Course note: **MYO063** students can take these tasks as a bonus (`"course": "MYO063"` in the reservation); at most **2 merged PRs per student**, so reserve at most two CLN tasks at a time.

| **CLN-23** | Disk Explorer page: read-only size tree, hotspots and seek | **Medium** · Medium |
| **CLN-24** | Project artifact signatures proved by marker files | **High** · Small–Medium |
| **CLN-25** | Tool-reported cache locations: environment, then the tool, then the default | **High** · Small |
| **CLN-26** | Learning loop: cleaned-items ledger, soft pre-selection, Quick Clean | **Medium** · Medium |
| **CLN-27** | Relocate caches to another volume behind a symlink | **Medium** · Medium |
| **CLN-28** | Volumes overview and disk-pressure card | **Medium** · Small |
| **CLN-29** | Simulator and emulator runtimes: list, size, remove | **Medium** · Small–Medium |

CLN-21 … CLN-29 start from working, tested reference code in [`cleanup-lab/reference/`](cleanup-lab/reference/README.md)
(the `qrust-scan` Rust crate and the `cleanup_ref` Python modules). Adapt it to the contract; do not bypass the safety guard.

### Source Lab bonus contributions — open

The owner deferred the following remaining verification and related patches to
bonus contributions. They are reservable in **Contribute → Roadmap & TODOs** as
`SRC-B01`–`SRC-B06`; they are not course exam options or claims of completed
native/live acceptance. Follow [the runbook](source-lab/RUNBOOK.md), record
sanitized evidence in [VALIDATION.md](source-lab/VALIDATION.md), and include any
required fixes with the verification. Release signatures remain mandatory.

| Task | Priority | Required result |
|---|---|---|
| SRC-B01 — Native install/update | High | Fresh packaged and minimal macOS/Windows install, restart/update with existing private state, Python 3.11+ readiness, five-platform portable acceptance fingerprint and Source UI/report smoke; parse Windows installer with PowerShell 5.1 and 7. |
| SRC-B02 — Live browser | High | Owned canary target, real Playwright/Chromium, signed non-synthetic session, deliberate tamper rejection, profile/process cleanup and documented optional-tool fallback. |
| SRC-B03 — Native telemetry | Medium | Authorized Windows/macOS/Android/iOS collection recipes feeding the four retained importer libraries, host/tool provenance, integrity checks and no fabricated live proof. |
| SRC-B04 — Snapshot generation | Medium | Reproducible Brain/Pipeline generation from owned source, revisions/dates/provider validation and absent-provider tests; no database, Skills or OpenAPI integration. |
| SRC-B05 — Native lifecycle/path checks | High | Cancellation/timeout/restart, cross-process locks, CRLF sessions, symlink/junction/reparse-point refusal and private-key behavior on actual native hosts; patch failures. |
| SRC-B06 — Large workspace browsing | Medium | Bounded pagination/summary-only reads beyond current target/session/aggregate limits, clear partial coverage and measured owned-fixture UI/API performance. |

Further merger UI is skipped by owner. Research-only collection and remote
hosting proposals remain separate upstream follow-ups, not hidden release
requirements or implemented capabilities. See [scope audit](source-lab/AUDIT.md).

## Step 4: Add tests

Add or update tests in `android-lab/lab/tests/` for any change in behaviour.
Tests run offline: mock network calls and never download from the internet.

## Step 5: Run the checks

GitHub Actions is disabled for this repository; the local runner replaces CI.
Run it before every pull request:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh          # everything
./scripts/run-tests.sh --quick  # unit tests only
```

It runs the pytest suite, a sample-analysis smoke test, `bash -n` on every
shell script, `lat check` when `lat` is installed, and, when
`dashboard/node_modules` exists, the dashboard typecheck plus a check that the
committed build is current.

## Step 6: Rebuild the dashboard if you changed it

`dashboard/dist/` is committed so hosts without Node.js still get the
dashboard. After changing anything in `dashboard/src/` or `docs/legal/`:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build      # refreshes dashboard/dist; commit it with your change
```

## Step 7: Update the docs and the knowledge graph

- Update the README of the area you changed.
- If you changed architecture, behaviour or tests, update the knowledge graph in
  [`lat.md/`](lat.md/) (what the project does and why, not a changelog) and run
  `lat check`.
- If you changed what data is stored or sent, or added a dependency, update
  [`docs/legal/`](docs/legal/).

## Step 8: Commit and open a pull request

1. Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
   for example `fix(android): …`, `feat(dashboard): …`, `docs: …`.
2. Push to your fork and open a pull request against `master`.
3. Fill in the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
   including how you tested the change.
4. Respond to review comments; maintainers merge once the checks pass and the
   review is done.
