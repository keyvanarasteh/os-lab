"""The plan → confirm → clean executor (CLN-13).

Ports the *behaviour* of Qleaner's ``clean_items`` / ``clean_leftovers`` /
``retry_remove`` (see ``cleanup-lab/PARITY.md``) without its bugs
(``cleanup-lab/README.md``, "Do not port"):

* **Trash by default.** Qleaner silently fell back to ``remove_dir_all`` when the
  Trash move failed and still counted the bytes. Here a failed Trash is a failed
  item: the file stays where it was, nothing is counted, and the error says why.
  Permanent deletion is a mode the plan must state explicitly — never a fallback.
* **Plan → confirm → run.** A plan is built from catalog entry ids (never a path
  list from the page), lists every item with its size, mode and refusal reason,
  and carries a fingerprint per item. Running re-measures first: an item that
  changed or vanished since the plan was made expires the whole plan. A plan is
  single-use and short-lived (:data:`PLAN_TTL`).
* **Honest results.** Per item one of ``trashed`` / ``deleted`` / ``skipped``
  (with a stable ``code`` and reason) / ``failed`` (with the error). Bytes are
  credited only when the item is really gone from its original path, and only in
  the amount measured in this run — never the plan's estimate, never a failed
  item's size. Transient ``OSError``s (EBUSY, ETXTBSY, …) are retried with a
  short backoff (:func:`retry`).
* **Guarded.** Every item goes through ``safety.check_target`` (CLN-12): resolved
  containment, ownership, running apps, privilege. The fingerprint walk never
  follows symlinks (rule 1).

Trash targets come from :func:`cleanup_lab.paths.trash_dir`: macOS ``~/.Trash``,
the freedesktop Trash (with ``.trashinfo``) on Linux. Windows has no folder the
engine may address, so a trash-mode item there fails with that reason instead of
being deleted (rule 3). A cross-volume item is copied, verified against a fresh
walk of the original, and only then removed from the source — and when removing
the original fails, the verified copy stays in the Trash instead of being
discarded, because it may hold the item's only remaining bytes.

Nothing here writes outside the Trash: planning and verifying are read-only.
