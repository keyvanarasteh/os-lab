# OS-30 Ubuntu baseline checker and selected repairs

The roadmap's Python entry point is `linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py`.
It uses only Python's standard library and delegates baseline collection to
`linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh`. The Bash file is now audit-only: its old `apply`
spelling exits 2 without mutations and points to the single Python repair path.

Run inside the authorized Ubuntu guest, including Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 on UTM.
The Python entry point refuses a missing/empty collector or a collector that
returns no findings, rather than reporting a clean audit.
The tool never connects to another machine, sources `.env`, or confuses host
forwarding port 2222 with guest port 22. It rejects non-Ubuntu platforms.
Both entry points recognize `ID=ubuntu` and
`ID="ubuntu"` in `/etc/os-release` without executing the file.

## Read-only audit

From the repository root, inside the guest:

```bash
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py audit --format json
bash linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh audit
```

An administrator can run audit in an existing privileged guest session for fuller
coverage. No automatic elevation or password prompt occurs. The audit never
refreshes package lists, installs updates, changes files, restarts services or
modifies UFW. Root-only `sudo -n -l -U USER` queries list policy for interactive
accounts without executing any permitted command. Names and firewall policy are
administrative evidence; review reports before sharing. Password hashes and
passwd GECOS/home fields are not printed.

Use an actual SSH connection context when investigating Match rules:

```bash
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py audit --context 'user=student,host=client.example,addr=192.0.2.10,laddr=192.0.2.20,lport=22'
```

The example addresses are documentation-only; substitute actual client hostname,
client IP, server IP and server port. `sshd -T -C` resolves Include/Match itself.
Global settings do not establish per-connection policy. Context provenance and
other Match branches remain WARN; disk configuration may differ from a running
daemon with old settings or different arguments.

Checks include SSH service/socket state, effective root/password/empty-password/
key/keyboard-interactive settings and standard config ownership/modes; non-root
UID 0, interactive accounts, password state, sudoers syntax and effective sudo
command specifications; cached upgrades, security-labelled candidates, cache age,
unattended-upgrades/package/policy/timers and reboot marker; UFW status, defaults
and existing rules. Systemd-owned SSH endpoints must match ssh.socket's Listen
metadata; unrelated systemd listeners are not attributed to SSH. Socket matching
alone does not prove remote reachability.

Explicit parser errors are FAIL; permission or inconclusive errors remain WARN.
SSH permissions are checked independently of sshd syntax. Custom Include paths,
parent directories, external policy semantics and service-account sudo privileges
still need review. `/bin/sync` is a utility, not an interactive shell; UID 0
checks still apply. Unknown shell paths remain visible.

The chosen SSH baseline requires root/password/empty-password login disabled and
public-key login enabled; audit reports deviations, without silently fixing them.
The chosen UFW baseline is active with deny incoming / allow outgoing. Other
defaults, including deliberately stricter egress rules, are deviations requiring
explicit policy review, not authorization to replace them. Missing tools or
privileges remain WARN. Security-labelled cached APT counts are approximate;
no complete candidate-origin analysis or cache freshness is asserted.

PASS applies only to a named check; WARN means incomplete evidence or review,
FAIL means a baseline violation, SKIP explains unsupported/omitted work.
Audit exit codes:

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Complete audit without FAIL (WARN may remain). |
| 1 | Complete audit with baseline violations (FAIL). |
| 2 | Usage, platform or collector error, or an incomplete audit. |

An audit is complete only when the collector exits 0/1, its output ends with
exactly one `Summary: N FAIL, M WARN` line, N/M equal the reported FAIL/WARN
findings and the exit code matches them. A collector that stops inside a check
reports `[FAIL] execution: audit stopped before completion` and exits 2; partial
findings are never presented as a baseline result. JSON schema version 1
records UTC time, `exit_code`, `complete`, `error`, per-status `summary` counts
and status/check/detail findings. With `--format json`, platform and collector
errors are valid JSON too (`exit_code` 2, `complete` false, `error` set).
Redirect output only if you explicitly want a report file; audit does not
create one automatically.

## Plan before any repair

The Python entry point requires an explicit allowlist; plain `apply` cannot
choose changes. `plan` has no writes, no backups and no commands that modify state.
Root is required to read complete repair preconditions. In an administrator
session **inside the guest**, review one repair at a time:

```bash
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py plan --fix ssh-permissions
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py plan --fix user-key-permissions --user student
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py plan --fix unattended-timer
python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py plan --fix ufw-ssh-rule --management-source 192.0.2.10 --ssh-port 22
```

Available repairs:

- `ssh-permissions`: set existing, root-owned standard sshd config files to 0600.
  Preserve contents and ownership. Validate `sshd -t` before and after. Require
  attributable actual SSH listeners. No reload, authentication or port change.
  A root-owned 0644 file can already pass the audit because it is not writable
  by others; selecting 0644 -> 0600 is an optional stricter profile, not proof
  that the existing mode is an audit FAIL.
- `user-key-permissions`: set the explicitly selected non-root user's existing,
  nonempty, user-owned authorized_keys file to 0600. Never recursively chmod a
  home or create accounts/keys. Refuse symlinks and unsafe directory ancestry;
  directory repairs and unexpected ownership require manual administrator review.
- `unattended-timer`: enable an installed apt-daily-upgrade.timer without --now,
  only if unattended-upgrades is already installed and enablement is unambiguous.
  Do not start services, change APT policy or install packages. Future schedules
  may install updates under the existing policy; consent covers that consequence.
- `ufw-ssh-rule`: add one TCP allow rule from one explicit client IP to an
  attributed actual SSH listener. No subnet, wildcard or command expression is
  accepted. Existing rules are classified with UFW's own identity fields:
  direction, interfaces, addresses, ports, apps and protocol identify a rule;
  action, log type and comment do not. Plan and apply use the same classifier:
  - an allow rule for the same connection is reported as
    `[SKIP] ufw-ssh-rule: equivalent allow rule ...` and left untouched, never retagged;
  - a deny, reject or limit rule for the same connection is refused before any
    change, because `ufw allow` would silently replace it in place ("Rule updated");
  - rules differing in direction (`out`), interface (`in on ...`), source port,
    app, destination, port or protocol are distinct: UFW appends the new rule
    and leaves them unchanged;
  - an unparseable rule that names the management source is refused.

  Apply re-reads the rule list and status and repeats the classification
  immediately before `ufw allow`. Snapshot user.rules/user6.rules and standard
  UFW control/default/before/after configuration files, and verify UFW's
  generated rule, tagged with a unique `OS-30:<run-id>` comment. Do not activate
  UFW, change default policies, reset/delete existing rules or assert that an
  earlier deny elsewhere in the rule order was overridden.

After reviewing the repair plan, replace `plan` with `apply`
and enter exactly `APPLY OS-30`. Both input and output must be TTYs. Piped answers,
--yes, different case and surrounding whitespace cannot authorize changes. There
is no automatic privilege escalation, command-string input or environment
variable root override.
Arguments and preconditions are checked before confirmation; state is rechecked
immediately after confirmation and before mutation. Already-satisfied permissions,
timer state or an equivalent UFW rule are SKIP no-ops. Apply exit codes (none of
them asserts a clean audit):

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Selected repairs applied and verified, or all already satisfied (SKIP). |
| 2 | Refused, or failed; this run's proven changes were reversed (manifest status `failed`). |
| 129 | SIGHUP (for example a dropped SSH session) during apply; see below. |
| 130 | Ctrl-C at the confirmation prompt (nothing changed) or SIGINT during apply. |
| 143 | SIGTERM during apply; see below. |

Snapshots and manifest are retained in root-only `/var/backups/os-30/repair-*`.
Schema-2 manifests record the run ID, selected operations, original snapshots
and hashes/modes/ownership, verified post-apply file/timer/firewall state, and
completion status. Manifest updates are private, atomic and fsynced. A shared
nonblocking repair lock prevents simultaneous OS-30 application/rollback.
Single-link regular files and no-follow file descriptors prevent linked-path
permission operations. No automatic recursive ownership changes occur.

### Failure and interruption during apply

While apply runs, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP are recorded instead of killing
the process in the middle of a command or file update. Apply stops at the next
checkpoint between steps and reverses only what is proven to be this run's
change:

- a permission mode, only if the file still has its original or its new mode
  with unchanged content, owner and group;
- the timer, only if this run enabled it (disabled again, never stopped/started);
- the UFW rule, only if this run's single `OS-30:<run-id>` rule was already
  verified and the complete rule list and status still equal the recorded
  post-addition state. It is deleted by its exact rule specification, never by
  number or reset. An unverified addition is left in place and reported.

Concurrent changes are never overwritten. The manifest records status `failed`
(error) or `interrupted` (signal) and a `recovery` object with the signal name,
the error, and `reverted`/`unreverted` items. The printed message names the
backup path and anything not reverted. A signal arriving after the final
checkpoint leaves a fully applied run (`applied`) with a warning. SIGKILL, power
loss or a kernel crash cannot be intercepted and leave status `applying`; the
UFW rule identity is journaled before `ufw allow` for that case. Manifests with
status `failed`, `interrupted` or `applying` are not rollback evidence: use the
manual recovery below. Backup failure stops before repairs.

### Manual recovery of an unfinished apply run

Use this only for a run whose manifest status is `applying`, `failed` or
`interrupted`; `rollback` refuses those. Work as root in a console or `tmux`,
one item at a time. Never copy snapshot contents back: OS-30 changes only modes,
timer enablement and at most one UFW rule. Do not edit the manifest to make
rollback accept it.

1. Read the run's status and recovery record:

   ```bash
   sudo ls -1d /var/backups/os-30/repair-*
   sudo python3 -m json.tool /var/backups/os-30/repair-<run-id>/manifest.json
   ```

   Modes are decimal (420 = 0644, 384 = 0600). `recovery.unreverted`, when
   present, lists what still needs review; `recovery.reverted` was already done.
2. For each `files[]` entry with `"operation": "mode"` that is not in
   `recovery.reverted`, compare the current state with the recorded original:

   ```bash
   sudo stat -c '%a %u %g %h' <path>; sudo sha256sum <path>
   ```

   Only when owner, group and SHA-256 equal the recorded `uid`, `gid` and
   `sha256`, the link count is 1 and the mode is the original or 600, restore
   the original: `sudo chmod <original mode in octal> <path>`. Anything else
   means an administrator changed the file: leave it. After SSH files run
   `sudo sshd -t`.
3. Timer: only if `timer_before` is `disabled` and
   `systemctl is-enabled apt-daily-upgrade.timer` prints `enabled`, run
   `sudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer` (no stop/start).
4. UFW: run `sudo ufw show added`. The pre-run list is `ufw.before.rules` in
   the manifest, or `sudo diff /var/backups/os-30/repair-<run-id>/<backup>
   /etc/ufw/user.rules` for the `files[]` entry of `/etc/ufw/user.rules`. If the
   only difference is one rule ending in `comment 'OS-30:<run-id>'`, delete
   exactly that rule:
   `sudo ufw delete allow from <source> to any port <port> proto tcp comment 'OS-30:<run-id>'`.
   Never use `ufw reset` or numbered deletion; any other difference needs an
   administrator decision.
5. Re-run `sudo python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py audit` and keep the
   backup directory as evidence.

These selected repairs do not make a server fully hardened. Disabling root or
password access, locking accounts and activating UFW remain outside automatic
application until an independent key/sudo connection and complete access path
can be verified. Docker-published ports require separate host review. The tool
never reports a repaired authentication/firewall baseline merely because an
additive rule or permission fix succeeded.

## Explicit rollback of a completed run

Use the suffix printed as `run-id` after a successful apply, not a path. For a
backup `/var/backups/os-30/repair-ab12cd34`, the command would be:

```bash
sudo python3 linux-lab/scripts/harden_check.py rollback ab12cd34
```

Review the plan in a recoverable, authorized lab before applying or rolling back.
Rollback verification uses fake commands and temporary fixtures; live UTM
rollback has not been verified.

The CLI accepts only a short lowercase alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen ID, never
a caller-supplied file path or alternative backup root. It reads only the matching
root-owned `repair-ID` directory under `/var/backups/os-30`. Backup root/run
folders must be real directories, root:root 0700; manifest and numbered snapshot
files must be single-link regular files, root:root 0600. Symlinks, traversal,
wrong ownership/modes, duplicate JSON keys, unknown operations, disallowed target
paths, altered snapshot hashes, legacy manifests and incomplete/failed apply
records are refused before system changes. Targets are limited to the recorded
standard SSH configs, selected user's authorized_keys and UFW snapshots.

A completed schema-2 manifest is required. Preview lists only the run's original
permission/timer changes and its own proven UFW rule. Root and input/output TTYs
are required, with the exact line `ROLLBACK OS-30 ab12cd34` for this example.
`APPLY OS-30`, piped input and surrounding whitespace do not authorize rollback.
Immediately before mutation, the shared lock is acquired and the manifest,
snapshots and current state are checked again.

File content hash, owner, group and mode must match the saved post-state.
Rollback only restores the previous mode through a no-follow file descriptor;
it never copies old content over a changed file, chowns an account, reloads SSH,
or restores a whole directory. Any permission-file or timer drift refuses the
entire rollback before target mutations. The timer's previous enablement is
restored only if this run changed it; no service is started or stopped.

For UFW, the saved before/after rule lists must prove exactly one addition with
the unique run marker. Current complete rule list, status and firewall file
fingerprints must match the recorded post-state. Only that validated rule may be
removed using fixed command arguments; no numbered-rule guessing, reset, enable,
default-policy change or removal of other rules is performed. An existing rule
that this run did not add is never removed. If identity/state cannot be proven,
UFW stays untouched, other proven repairs may be reverted, and the result is
**partial rollback, exit 2**, with a warning and backup location. A delete failure
or failed postcondition also stops with partial-state evidence; no second rule
is guessed/deleted. Inspect the retained manifest/snapshots before recovery.

Rollback progress is atomically journaled per operation. A partial run can be
retried only when the saved progress and current state agree; completed steps
are not repeated. An interruption after an intended step but before its progress
write is reconciled only against the exact saved previous state. A completed
rollback reports SKIP/no-op on repetition (exit 0), provided the restored state
still matches; later administrator changes are never overwritten. Old backups
without schema-2 post-state remain available for manual inspection but cannot be
automatically migrated into trusted rollback evidence. Do not hand-edit journals
to bypass refusal checks.

Rollback exit codes:

| Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Run restored, or an already rolled back run repeated as a no-op. |
| 2 | Refused before changes, partial rollback (UFW untouched), or stopped after a command failure or Ctrl-C during restoration; the journal allows a safe retry. |
| 130 | Ctrl-C at the confirmation prompt; nothing changed. |

Rollback does not intercept SIGTERM/SIGHUP. If one terminates it, the shell
usually reports 143/129; the per-operation journal makes a repeated
`rollback <run-id>` resume the remaining steps or report a no-op.

## Tests and evidence

Focused tests use fake OS commands and temporary files. The latest recorded run
(test count, tested base commit and patch, operating system, Python version and
result) is in `VERIFY.md`; it is separate from historical local and
operator-reported UTM checks.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s linux-lab/tests -v
bash -n linux-lab/scripts/hardening.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Bash audit tests use command mocks. Python repair tests use a fake OS boundary and
temporary files, including backup/postcondition/rollback/refusal scenarios. Real
PTY tests exercise consent against fake operations. Interruption tests deliver
real SIGTERM/SIGHUP signals to a forked test process that runs fake operations.
None mutate actual SSH, apt, accounts or UFW. Test dependencies may be provisioned before running offline tests;
tests themselves must not download dependencies or query external services.
The repository runner retains its existing dependency preparation; with network
access prohibited, use the focused unittest command unless dependencies are
already provisioned. No package installation is needed for the focused suite.

See `VERIFY.md` for executed checks and UTM evidence, and `REPORT.md` for
delivery scope. Historical audit runs do not verify later repair/rollback changes.

## Sharing evidence

Use synthetic fixtures or sanitized summaries in shared documents and videos.
Do not copy raw server audit output, account names, real addresses/hostnames,
local home paths, passwords or key material. Documentation examples use reserved
addresses and generic account names. JSON formatting tests with fakes are not
live JSON-audit evidence; live apply/rollback needs separate verification.
